1. What is the shortest path between DR. STRANGE and DR. DOOM?

MATCH (drs:Hero)
WHERE drs.name =~ ".*STRANGE.*"
RETURN drs;

gives a bunch, let's go with DR. STRANGE/STEPHEN as it has the most degrees

MATCH (drd:Hero)
WHERE drd.name =~ ".*DOOM.*"
RETURN drd;

gives a bunch, let's go with DR. DOOM/VICTOR VON as it has the most degrees

MATCH p=(drs:Hero {name: 'DR. STRANGE/STEPHEN'})-[:APPEARED*0..2]-(drd:Hero {name: 'DR. DOOM/VICTOR VON'})
RETURN p, length(p)
ORDER BY length(p)
LIMIT 1;


2. List the 5 shortest paths between DR. STRANGE and DR. DOOM

MATCH p=(drs:Hero {name: 'DR. STRANGE/STEPHEN'})-[:APPEARED*0..2]-(drd:Hero {name: 'DR. DOOM/VICTOR VON'})
RETURN p, length(p)
ORDER BY length(p)
LIMIT 5;

3. List 5 Friends of Friends with the most connections and COLOSSUS II.

MATCH (col:Hero)
WHERE col.name =~ ".*COLOSSUS.*"
RETURN col;

COLOSSUS II/PETER RA has the most degrees for a Colossus II

MATCH (col:Hero { name: 'COLOSSUS II/PETER RA' })-[:APPEARED*2..2]-(friend_of_friend)
WHERE NOT (col)-[:APPEARED]-(friend_of_friend)
AND friend_of_friend.name <> 'COLOSSUS II/PETER RA'
RETURN friend_of_friend.name, COUNT(*)
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC , friend_of_friend.name
LIMIT 5;

4. Visualize 10 Friends of friends for IRON MAN.

MATCH (tony:Hero { name: 'IRON MAN/TONY STARK' })-[:APPEARED*2..2]-(friend_of_friend)
WHERE NOT (tony)-[:APPEARED]-(friend_of_friend)
AND friend_of_friend.name <> 'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'
RETURN friend_of_friend
LIMIT 10;


5. Discover how the Avengers grew over time from 5 to 10. Find team members starting with 5 and incrementing to 10. Who was added to the team? Is the resulting graph ever not fully connected?

X-men are cooler.


MATCH (tony:Hero {name:'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (donald:Hero {name:'THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK'})
RETURN other
ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC
LIMIT 5;

MATCH (tony:Hero {name:'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (donald:Hero {name:'THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK'})
RETURN other
ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC
LIMIT 6;

MATCH (tony:Hero {name:'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (donald:Hero {name:'THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK'})
RETURN other
ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC
LIMIT 7;

MATCH (tony:Hero {name:'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (donald:Hero {name:'THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK'})
RETURN other
ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC
LIMIT 8;

MATCH (tony:Hero {name:'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (donald:Hero {name:'THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK'})
RETURN other
ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC
LIMIT 9;

MATCH (tony:Hero {name:'IRON MAN/TONY STARK'}) -[e:APPEARED]-> (other) <-[f:APPEARED]- (donald:Hero {name:'THOR/DR. DONALD BLAK'})
RETURN other
ORDER BY e.w DESC, f.w DESC
LIMIT 10;

According to this db, the team started with the Wasp, Ant-Man, Capt America, Vision, and Scarlet Witch.  Although as an avid comic book nerd, I can tell you that the Scarlet Witch joined much later, but whatevs.  After that, apparently, Wonderman joined, then Hawk[eye], then a new Iron Man, then Edwin Jarvis, then Mr Fantastic.  Clearly, the Hulk doesn't exist, and what about the Black Panther? sheesh.
