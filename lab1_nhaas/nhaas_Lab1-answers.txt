#2- Provide the answers to the following questions in a file called Lab1-answers.txt
#Q1: What is the difference between EBS and S3?

#  Both are storage option for AWS.  S3 stands for Simple Storage Service and is for Big  
# Data, you'd want S3 storage if you had terabytes of data. In addition, S3 is more like a 
# service, and can be accessed using RESTful API. It appears to also be distributed       
# storage (https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#)
#  EBS is a persistent storage option for AWS.  It stands for Elastic Block Store and     
# mirrors the traditional storage you would have on a physical machine
# (https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/?tag=cnet-viglink-20)
#

#Q2: When would you consider a cloud infrastructure for your data science tasks?

# Could infrastructure would be ideal when my tasks involve medium-big size datasets
# and when cost is a factor.  I certainly can't afford my own servers and nodes.  
# They'd also be pretty handy if I needed to collaborate with others so we could all log in.
# I would not use cloud infrastructure when security is a consideration, such as if I were
# to deal with information protected under HIPAA or PII laws.

#Q3: What is the difference between spot instances and reserved instances?

#  Spot instances would be when I would need to spin up a virtual machine or server as needed.
#  Our R&D department at work is trying out a PrestoDB instance that we just spin up as we need
#  to see if it is cost effective.  (So far, it's is losing to Spark, so it probably won't go forward)
#  A reserved instance would be a vm that always exists.


# Q4: List the names of four software packages installed on the UCB AMI.

# Python 2.6
# Hadoop
# Linux
# Apache Storm
